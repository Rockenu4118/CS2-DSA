// Payroll
// 
// Design a PayRoll class that has data members for an employeeâ€™s hourly pay rate, 
// number of hours worked of type double. The default constructor will set the hours 
// worked and pay rate to zero. The class must have a mutator function to set the pay 
// rate for each employee and hours worked. The class should include accessors for both 
// the hours worked and the rate of pay. The class should lastly have a getGross function 
// that will return a double calculated by multiplying the hours worked by the rate of pay.
// 
// Write a program with an array of seven PayRoll objects. The program should ask the 
// user for the rate of pay for each employee and the number of hours each employee 
// has worked. Be sure to include an employee claiming to work more then 60 hours per week. 
// Print out, the array number of the employee, the hours worked, the rate of pay, and the gross pay, 
// of all the employee's each on their own line. Set the precision for printing the doubles to 
// two decimal places.
// 
// Input Validation: Do not accept values greater than 60 for the number of hours worked, simply have 
// the set function set number of hours worked to 60, the maximum allowed.
